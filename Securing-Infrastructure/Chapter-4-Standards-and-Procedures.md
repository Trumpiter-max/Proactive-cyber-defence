# Chapter 4. Standards and Procedures


Standards and procedures are two sets of documentation that support the policies and bring them to life.

Advantages of standards and procedures:
- Consistency
- Distribution of knowledge
- Setting expectations
- Regulatory compliance
- Management endorsement

## Standards

- Provide the “how” portion to a policy at a technology viewpoint without specific procedural detail.
- Provides more detail as to what constitutes a password should accompany this policy statement

- Separating this into two documents — three once we talk about procedures — provides several advantage
  - Documents are easier to consume
  - Lack of repetition
  - Ease of maintenance

## Language

- Should be fairly simple, clear, and use words like “do,” “will,” “must,” and “shall.” They
should not be ambiguous or use words and phrases such as “should,” “try,” or
“mostly.”

## Procedures

- Take the step made from policies to standards and makes another similarly sized step further along the same trajectory
  - Take the detail from standards
  - Provide specific steps in order to achieve those standards.
