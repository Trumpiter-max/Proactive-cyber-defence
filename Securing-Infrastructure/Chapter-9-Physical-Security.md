## Physical

### Restrict Access

- Restricting access to the premises
or portions of the premises
- Badge systems prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access to secure
areas where they might be able to steal, interfere with, disable, or otherwise harm systems and data

### Video Surveillance

- Cameras would typically be located at major ingress and egress points, such as a
lobby area as well as, or particularly sensitive areas such as server rooms
- Surveillance or CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras should be placed pointing at entrance doors to the building, areas of high importance or sensitivity,wherever else a
high risk has been identified

### Authentication Maintenance

Maintenance also includes changes in staff. In
the event that a member of staff ceases to be a member of staff, should surrender badge, along with any keys

### Secure Media

- Prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to sensitive data on any type of media
- Media may be lost or stolen if sent via a nontrackable method, such as regular mail

### Datacenters

- Use rackable equipment so that locking server racks can be utilized
- Office routers, switches, and maybe a read-only domain controller are not extremely important, but they are still a potential vector of attack

## Operational

### Identify Visitors and Contractors

Quickly determine an approximate level of trust that they can place on a person with whom they are not already familiar

### Visitor Actions

- Sign-in/Sign-out procedure should be required
- Any action involving technology, equipment, or potential information gathering should require an employee verification of intent

### Contractor Actions

Proper policy and guidelines should be set
on who the contractor works through for identification and access

### Badges

Visitor badges should be restricted to only the duration of the visitorâ€™s stay and surrendered when they sign out, automatically void after a certain time limit

### Include Physical Security Training

Some scenarios and types of potential malicious activities
- Tailgating
- Badge cloning
- Malicious media
- Restricted access
- Pretexts
