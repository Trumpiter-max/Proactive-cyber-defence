Notes: some of the key checkpoints:

- `Source and Destination IP Addresses`: Review the source and destination IP addresses to identify the communication between different hosts and networks

- `Protocols and Ports`: Identify the protocols used and the associated ports, such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc

- `Timestamps`: Check the timestamps to understand the timing of the network communication

- `Packet Lengths`: Analyze the packet lengths to identify potential anomalies, such as large or small packets

- `Payloads`: Analyze the packet payloads to identify the data being transmitted, such as email messages, file transfers, or other types of data

- `Errors and Warnings`: Check for errors and warnings that might indicate issues or problems with the network

- `Flow Analysis`:` Analyze the flow of network traffic to understand the sequence of packets, the direction of traffic, and the duration of the communication

- `Behavior Analysis`: Look for patterns or behaviors that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts, large amounts of data being transferred, or unusual communication patterns
