In this chapter:
    - As a security practitioner, we will examine different aspects of a system compromise at the network kernel:
      - Network reconnaissance
      - Malicious traffic redirection
      - System exploitation
    - With role of an intrusion analyst, we wil dissect traffic based on alerts from an Intrusion-detection system (IDS)
  
## Reconnaissance

- SYN Scan (stealth scan, half-open scan)
  - This is the most common type scanning when against a system
  - Using Filters
  - Identifying Open and Closed Ports

- Operating System Fingerprinting
  - Passive 
  - Active

## Exploitation

- Operation Aurora
- ARP Cache Poisoning
- Remote-Access Trojan
